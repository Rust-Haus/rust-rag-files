RUST BASE BUILDING GUIDE
========================
Your base is your home - protect it well.

## STARTER BASES
- 2x1: Cheapest option, single airlock
- 2x2: Better storage, basic security
- Triangle foundations save resources

## KEY CONCEPTS
- Airlock: Double doors prevent door camping
- Honeycomb: Extra layers of walls
- Tool Cupboard (TC): Place deep in base
- Multiple TCs for larger bases

## UPGRADE PRIORITY
1. Doors: Sheet metal doors ASAP
2. Core: Stone minimum, metal preferred
3. Walls facing outward: Soft side faces in

## BUILDING TIPS
- Always upgrade from twig immediately
- Doors open inward to prevent camping
- Windows are weak - use embrasures
- Garage doors are very strong
- Use code locks, not key locks
